    <h1 style="font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;">How does an iframe work?</h1>
    <p>An iframe is an element of HTML code. It is supported by all major web browsers and is included in the latest HTML5 specifications.
    When the web browser encounters an iframe element, it creates a new HTML document environment to load the content within. It takes the 
    code from the referenced src or srcdoc and renders it as its own website that is then put entirely within the parent browsing page. It is 
    called an inline frame because to the user it is all one web page.The child iframe is a complete browsing environment within the parent frame.
    It can load its own JavaScript and CSS separate from the parent. They can also be refreshed and loaded asynchronously from the parent site.
    The parent site can define aspects of the iframe such as size, position and security context. Administrators should use caution when using more
    than one iframe. Since they require additional memory and processing, their overuse can cause the page to perform poorly. The iframe content may 
    not be properly indexed, so it may affect a site's SEO.</p>

    <h2 style="font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;">How is Ifram is used?</h2>
    <p>The most common use of an iframe is to load content from another site within the page
    The child site can load its own content and cookies,so sites may allow it where they don't allow 
    direct hotlinking content. Using an iframe is the accepted way to embed a YouTube video or Google Maps
    content.This is also how many web ads and trackers work.The site owner puts the iframe in the appropriate
    portion of their site. When the browsercalls the ad site, it loads an appropriate ad and counts the viewer.
    Third-party web analyticstools may also use a hidden iframe to monitor the user without being seen.An iframe 
    may also be used to load dynamic or changing page content. For example, imagine a simple documentation website. 
    The parent site shows a list of pages along the left side of the screen and has an iframe in the center of the page. 
    When the user clicks a page to view in the menu, it can load the content within the iframe without navigating away from the
    parent page.Using an iframe for dynamic content is simple and effective, but it is becoming less popular. New methods of
    creating dynamic web content using dynamic HTML and AJAX are now more common. Such methods can create more interactive and i
    ntegrated sites than using an iframe to load another static page</p>
